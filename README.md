# TileDB-Examples

This is a repository dedicated to example of TileDB Usage.

## Quickstart

The [quickstart](Quickstart.ipynb) notebook has a brief overview of TileDB and
TileDB Cloud. It will introduce you to querying an array, user defined
functions and serverless sql.

## Quickstart VCF

The [quickstart-vcf](Quickstart-vcf.ipynb) notebook has a brief overview of
TileDB-VCF, one of the genomic tools TileDB, Inc. has developed.

## Quickstart Delayed

The [quickstart-delayed](Quickstart-Delayed.ipynb) notebook has an overview
of TileDB Cloud's delayed and tak graph APIs. This will walk you through performing
user defined functions, severless sql and task graphs.

## Geospatial SAR

There are a number of SAR example notebooks under [geo/sar](geo/sar). 

## Genomics

We have multiple example of using TileDB-VCF under [genomics](genomics).

## Machine Learning
We have an example of using TileDB in order to train an image classification model with Tensorflow and Keras under [machine_learning/image_classification_tf_keras](machine_learning/image_classification_tf_keras).
